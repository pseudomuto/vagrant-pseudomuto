# Vagrant::Pseudomuto

This is my custom vagrant plugin for managing guest machine setup.

Since this is mostly just for my custom setup, and likely only useful to others as a reference, I won't be publishing this gem to rubygems.

## Installation

```
gem 'vagrant-pseudomuto', github: 'pseudomuto/vagrant-pseudomuto'
